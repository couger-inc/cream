# contracts TODOs

> this CREAM contract implements with ERC-721 which is `NOT` a good idea to use in the public chain since it's traceable characteristic.

## In order to make it useful, we need either:

* non-token transfer related voting (i.e. message signal like MACI), use token to verify registration, etc.
* ERC 20 token implementation.
* Use nightfall kind of approach (i.e. mint, burn, transfer)
